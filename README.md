# Tableau Project- Where are the unicorns from?

I created an interactive data visualization using Tableau that highlights the patterns in a data set; the work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

The CrunchBase data I used contains the information about global startup companies, investment, and acquisitions from 1902 to 2014. 
With the dataset, we can learn the development of startups from different aspects.
